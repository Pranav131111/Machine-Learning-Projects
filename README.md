MOVIE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM


This project implements a movie recommender system using the TMDB movies dataset. The system leverages ast.literal_eval for safe evaluation of string literals, CountVectorizer from sklearn for text feature extraction, and cosine similarity for determining movie similarities. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accurate recommendations. Users can input a movie title and receive a list of similar movies based on plot descriptions and metadata.
